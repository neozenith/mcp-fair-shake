the employee is an existing member of a stapled superannuation 
fund and, if stapled fund details are provided by the ATO, make 
contributions to the stapled fund. 
(c) If an employee does not choose a superannuation fund and does 
not have a stapled fund, the choice of superannuation fund 
requirements will be satisfied by contributions made to a 
superannuation fund nominated in the award covering the 
employee, provided the fund is able to accept contributions for 
the benefit of the employee. 
(d) A fund may not be able to accept contributions for the benefit of 
an employee if the employee would be a new member of the

members because it has failed the performance tests of Australian 
Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) for 2 consecutive years. 
21.2 Employer contributions 
An employer must make such superannuation contributions to a superannuation 
fund for the benefit of an employee as will avoid the employer being required to pay

in respect of new employees, the fund is able to accept new beneficiaries: 
(a) Retail Employees Superannuation Trust (REST); 
(b) CareSuper;  
(c) Hostplus; 
(d) Sunsuper; 
(e) any superannuation fund to which the employer was making superannuation

offers a MySuper product or is an exempt public sector superannuation 
scheme; or

Schedule E—School-based Apprentices 
E.1 In this Schedule: 
E.1.1 off-the-job training is structured training delivered by a Registered Training 
Organisation separate from normal work duties or general supervised practice 
undertaken on the job; and 
E.1.2 school-based apprentice is a person who is undertaking an apprenticeship in 
accordance with this schedule while also undertaking a course of secondary 
education. 
E.2 A school-based apprenticeship may be undertaken in the trades covered by this 
award under a training agreement for an apprentice declared or recognised by the 
relevant State or Territory authority. 
E.3 The relevant minimum hourly rates for full-time junior and adult apprentices 
provided for in this award apply to school-based apprentices for total hours worked, 
including time taken to be spent in off-the-job training. 
E.4 Where an apprentice is a full-time school student, the time spent in off-the-job 
training, for which the apprentice must be paid, is 25% of the actual hours worked 
each week on-the-job. The wages paid for time spent in training may be averaged 
over the semester or year. 
E.5 A school-based apprentice must be allowed, over the duration of the

12 months’ progression for each 2 years of employment as an apprentice or at the 
rate of competency-based progression if provided for in this award. 
E.8 The apprentice wage scales are based on a standard full-time apprenticeship of 4 
years (unless the apprenticeship is of 3 years’ duration) or stages of competency-
based progression (if provided for in this award). 
NOTE: The rate of progression reflects the average rate of skill acquisition expected 
from the typical combination of work and training for a school-based apprentice 
undertaking the applicable apprenticeship. 
E.9 If an apprentice converts from school-based to full-time, the successful completion 
of competencies (if provided for in this award) and all time spent as a full-time
