 (3) Nothing in this Act entitles a worker to 
compensation in respect of a disease due to the 
nature of any employment in which the worker 
was employed unless the worker has been 
employed in employment of that nature on or after 
the appointed day but before 1 July 2014. 
 (4) On and after 1 July 2014, a claim for 
compensation under this Act must be given, 
served or lodged in accordance with section 20 
of the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and 
Compensation Act 2013. 
 (5) This Act must be read and construed as one with 
the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and 
Compensation Act 2013. 
 4A Interpretation 
 
 
 (1) If a worker commences or has commenced to 
receive compensation in the form of weekly 
payments, the entitlement of that worker to 
continue to receive weekly payments and the 
amount of those weekly payments depends upon 
the provisions of this Act as in force from time to 
time. 
 (2) Subsection (1) applies irrespective of the date 
(whether before or after the commencement of 
section 4 of the Accident Compensation 
(Further Amendment) Act 1988 and whether 
before or after the commencement of any other 
Act amending this Act, whether enacted before or 
after the first-mentioned Act)— 
 (a) on which a worker commences or 
commenced to receive weekly payments; and 
 (b) of any claim, notice or application.

 80 Entitlement to compensation only if employment 
connected with Victoria 
 (1) There is no entitlement to compensation under this 
Act other than in respect of employment that is 
connected with this State. 
 (2) The fact that a worker is outside this State when 
the injury happens does not prevent an entitlement 
to compensation arising under this Act in respect 
of employment that is connected with this State. 
 (3) A worker's employment is connected with— 
 (a) the State in which the worker usually works 
in that employment; or 
 (b) if no State or no one State is identified by 
paragraph (a), the State in which the worker 
is usually based for the purposes of that 
employment; or 
 (c) if no State or no one State is identified by 
paragraph (a) or (b), the State in which the 
employer's principal place of business in 
Australia is located. 
 (4) In the case of a worker working on a ship, 
if no State or no one State is identified by 
subsection (3), a worker's employment is, while 
working on a ship, connected with the State in 
which the ship is registered or (if the ship is 
registered in more than one State) the State in 
which the ship most recently became registered. 
 (5) If no State is identified by subsection (3) or 
(if applicable) (4), a worker's employment is 
connected with this State if—

 (a) a worker is in this State when the injury 
happens; and 
 (b) there is no place outside Australia under the 
legislation of which the worker may be 
entitled to compensation for the same matter. 
 (6) In deciding whether a worker usually works in a 
State, regard must be had to the worker's work 
history with the employer over the preceding 
12 months and the intentions of the worker and 
employer. However, regard must not be had to 
any temporary arrangement under which the 
worker works in a State for a period of not longer 
than 6 months. 
 (7) Subject to subsection (6), in determining whether 
a worker usually works in a State or is usually 
based in a State for the purposes of employment, 
regard must be had to any period during which a 
worker works in a State or is in a State for the 
purposes of employment whether or not under the 
statutory workers compensation scheme of that 
State the person is regarded as a worker or as 
working or employed in that State.

materially contributes to, the worker having 
either a current work capacity or no current 
work capacity; or 
 (b) the death of a worker is caused, or materially 
contributed to, by a disease— 
and the disease is due to the nature of any

at any time before notice of an injury relating 
to the disease is given under section 102, the 
worker or the worker's dependants are entitled to 
compensation under this Act as if the disease 
were an injury arising out of or in the course of 
employment. 
Note

47   
 (1A) For the purposes of subsection (1), a disease 
suffered by a worker is to be regarded as due to 
the nature of employment if, and only if, the 
nature of the employment gave rise to a 
significantly greater risk of the worker contracting 
the disease than had the worker not been 
employed in employment of that nature. 
 (2) Despite subsection (1), compensation is not 
payable in respect of a disease to the extent that 
the disease consists of, is caused by, results in or 
is associated with a heart attack injury or a stroke 
injury unless the worker's employment was a 
significant contributing factor to the disease or to 
the injury. 
Note 
This section in its current form only applies to injuries that occur 
on or after the date of commencement of section 3 of the Accident 
Compensation and Transport Accident Acts (Amendment)

 (3) The percentage shall be the difference between— 
 (a) the total percentage of the diminution of 
hearing in respect of industrial deafness from 
which the worker was suffering immediately 
after the further injury in respect of which 
the claim is made; and 
Note 
The percentage NAL loss is to be determined in 
accordance with section 91(4).  The percentage 
NAL loss is then converted in accordance with

Note 
The percentage NAL loss is to be determined in 
accordance with section 89(3C).  The percentage 
NAL loss is then converted in accordance with 
section 91(3A). 
 (3A) Despite anything to the contrary in this Act, a 
worker who suffers a further injury is not entitled 
to compensation under this section or section 98C 
unless the worker has a diminution of hearing 
assessed as a binaural loss of hearing of at least 
10 percent NAL resulting from the further injury 
and any prior injury or prior hearing loss.

 (3C) The total percentage referred to in 
subsection (3)(b) is to be determined by reference 
to— 
 (a) if a percentage has been determined in 
accordance with the Improved Procedure for 
Determination of Percentage Loss of Hearing 
(1988 Edition or a later prescribed edition) 
published by the National Acoustic 
Laboratory, that percentage; or 
 (b) in any other case, the percentage which 
having regard to the medical evidence 
available is determined to be the equivalent 
of the percentage that (as nearly as can be 
estimated) would have been determined in 
accordance with the Improved Procedure for 
Determination of Percentage Loss of Hearing 
(1988 Edition or a later prescribed edition) 
published by the National Acoustic 
Laboratory. 
 (3D) If a worker disputes the total percentage referred 
to in subsection (3)(b) as determined in 
accordance with subsection (3C), the Authority, 
self-insurer or a court must refer the question of 
what is the amount of the total percentage referred 
to in subsection (3)(b) as a medical question to a

or surgical treatment undergone by the 
worker in respect of the injury. 
 (1B) The A.M.A Guides apply in respect of an 
assessment under section 3.3d of Chapter 3 of the 
A.M.A Guides as if the following were omitted— 
"with the Injury Model, surgery to treat an 
impairment does not modify the original 
impairment estimate, which remains the 
same in spite of any changes in signs or 
symptoms that may follow the surgery and 
irrespective of whether the patient has a 
favourable or unfavourable response to 
treatment". 
 (2) In assessing a degree of impairment under 
subsection (1), regard must not be had to any 
psychiatric or psychological injury, impairment 
or symptoms arising as a consequence of, or 
secondary to, a physical injury. 
 (3) For the purposes of assessing the degree of 
impairment of the whole person resulting from 
diminution of hearing, the percentage of the 
diminution of hearing determined in accordance 
with subsection (4) is to be converted as 
follows— 
 (a) if the diminution of hearing assessed as a 
binaural loss of hearing is less than 10 per 
cent NAL, the degree of impairment is zero; 
 (b) if the diminution of hearing assessed as a 
binaural loss of hearing is 10 per cent NAL, 
the degree of impairment is 10 per cent; 
 (c) if the diminution of hearing assessed as a 
binaural loss of hearing is more than 10 per 
cent NAL, the degree of impairment is the 
percentage equivalent of the number

limits 
 (1) The Authority or a self-insurer may extend or

(including a time limit imposed under subsection 
(4)) as it applies to a worker, on the written

limit has expired. 
 (4) In extending or waiving a time limit, the Authority

 (b) in the case of a waiver, any entitlement to 
apply for a settlement that ceased on the 
expiry of the time limit is revived; and 
 (c) in the case of a worker seeking a settlement

apply for the settlement is to cease if the 
worker does not do the relevant act before 
the expiry of the time limit specified under 
subsection (4).

 (i) in respect of a contributor which is a 
contributing employer or a contributing 
self-insurer, the amount that the 
contributor would have been liable to 
pay as compensation whether by way 
of weekly payments, redemption, 
compromise or otherwise in accordance 
with the Workers Compensation 
Act 1958; or 
 (ii) in respect of a contributor which is a 
contributing insurer, the amount that 
would have been payable by the 
contributor whether by way of weekly 
payments, redemption, compromise, 
settlement or otherwise under the 
policy of insurance or indemnity 
obtained under section 72 of the 
Workers Compensation Act 1958—

incapacity, death or physical or mental condition

this Part including any claim for compensation or 
any certificate or report by a provider of medical, 
hospital, nursing, personal and household or 
ambulance services or any assessor's report or any 
other document from the worker's employer 
relating to any injury to or incapacity of the 
worker or filed with a court or tribunal in relation

this Act or the Workers Compensation Act 1958 
or damages provided always that the giving or 
exchange of documents under this section shall 
not extend to documents in relation to which any 
legal privilege attaches. 
 (5) In determining the amount or amounts to be 
payable as contribution in an assessment, the 
Authority may determine and set out in the 
assessment the present and future liability of the 
contributor to pay amounts as contribution in 
respect of payments made or to be made under 
this Act or the Accident Compensation 
(WorkCover Insurance) Act 1993 upon terms 
and conditions set out in the assessment that the 
Authority believes to be just and equitable. 
 (6) The Authority may, at any time, amend an 
assessment made under this section by making 
such alterations, reductions or additions to it as the 
Authority deems appropriate, whether or not an 
amount has been paid under the assessment. 
 (7) An amended assessment is an assessment for the 
purposes of this Division. 
 (8) The Authority or a self-insurer, as the case 
requires, shall within a reasonable time after the 
making of an assessment— 
 (a) serve a copy of the assessment on each 
contributor; and

amended by 
No. 50/1994

 (b) serve on each contributor a notice stating the 
grounds on which the Authority believes that 
the contributor ought to pay such amount or

 (9) The validity of an assessment and the liability of a 
contributor to pay any amount determined to be 
payable by an assessment is not affected by reason 
that any of the provisions of this Act or the 
Accident Compensation (WorkCover 
Insurance) Act 1993 have not been complied 
with or a claim for compensation has not been 
determined but any failure to comply with the 
provisions of this Act or the Accident 
Compensation (WorkCover Insurance) 
Act 1993 or the fact that a claim has not been 
determined may be taken into account by the 
Tribunal in any review of the assessment. 
 (10) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Division a contributor is not required to make 
payments of a contribution which relates to any 
amount of compensation to be paid prior to that 
compensation being paid. 
 129E Evidence 
 (1) The production of an assessment, a copy of an 
assessment or of a copy of a document under the 
hand of the Chief Executive of the Authority 
purporting to be an assessment or a copy of an 
assessment is conclusive evidence of the due 
making of the assessment and (except in 
proceedings before the Tribunal under this 
Division for a review of the assessment) that the 
amount payable under and all the particulars of 
the assessment are correct.

a copy of an assessment by the Authority shall be 
conclusive evidence that the assessment was by 
the Authority in accordance with this Division. 
 129F Recovery of amounts assessed as payable 
 (1) An amount determined to be payable by an 
assessment by the Authority under section 129D is 
due and payable to the Authority or self-insurer, 
as the case requires, by each person liable to pay 
the amount in accordance with the terms and 
conditions as to payment set out in the assessment 
and if periodic payments are required to be paid 
then those payments shall be made at such 
intervals between payments as the Authority or 
the Tribunal determines to be reasonable. 
 (2) A contributor is not required under this section 
to pay any amount payable by reason of an 
assessment within less than 28 days after service 
of a copy of the assessment on the contributor. 
 (3) The Authority or a self-insurer, as the case 
requires, may, in writing, grant an extension of 
time for payment of any amount determined to be 
payable by an assessment (whether or not the 
time has expired) or permit payment of any such 
amount by such instalments and within such time 
as it considers the circumstances warrant and, in 
such a case, the amount is due and payable 
accordingly. 
 (4) If an amount determined by an assessment to be 
payable as contribution remains unpaid after 
the time when it became due and payable in 
accordance with the provisions of this Division, 
the person liable to pay the amount shall pay 
interest at the prescribed rate on the amount

amount was due and payable until payment. 
 (5) If interest is due and payable by a person under 
this section and the Authority or a self-insurer, as 
the case requires, is satisfied that there are special 
circumstances by reason of which it would be just 
and equitable to remit the interest or part of the 
interest, the Authority or self-insurer may remit 
the interest or a part of the interest. 
 (6) A contributor and the Authority or self-insurer 
may agree or the Tribunal may determine that 
the contributor pay a lump sum in full and final 
settlement of its liability to make payments under 
this Division, including future periodic payments, 
in accordance with the assessment. 
 (7) An agreement or determination under

for the purposes of this Division. 
 (8) An amount determined to be payable by an 
assessment as contribution to the Authority, 
including interest payable (if any), when it 
becomes due and payable, is a debt due to

assessment as contribution to a self-insurer, 
including interest payable (if any), when it 
becomes due and payable is a debt due and 
payable to the self-insurer.

may be sued for and recovered in any court of 
competent jurisdiction.

 129G Review of assessment 
 (1) If a contributor is dissatisfied with any assessment 
under this Division, the contributor may, if the 
contributor has paid the amount determined to be 
payable by the assessment within 28 days after 
service of a copy of the assessment on the 
contributor, post to, or lodge with, the Authority 
an objection in writing against the assessment 
stating the amount (if any) the contributor 
contends should be payable as contribution and 
stating fully the grounds on which the contributor 
relies but, if the assessment is an amended 
assessment, and the objection is posted to or 
lodged with the Authority after the period of 
28 days, after notice of the original assessment 
was served, the contributor may object only 
against the amendment. 
 (2) The Authority, within 28 days after receiving the 
objection, shall consider the objection and either 
disallow it or allow it either wholly or in part by 
amending, or further amending, the assessment 
and shall serve on the contributor and, in the case 
of an assessment under section 129D(2), on the 
self-insurer, notice of its decision and any 
amendment. 
 (3) If— 
 (a) a contributor is dissatisfied with the decision 
and any amendment made under 
subsection (2); or 
 (b) the Authority does not, within 28 days after 
receiving an objection from a contributor, 
comply with subsection (2)— 
the contributor may, within 28 days after service 
of the notice of the decision on the contributor or, 
where paragraph (b) applies, after the Authority

 (8) The Tribunal when hearing an application shall 
determine which party shall bear the burden of 
satisfying the Tribunal that the assessment or the 
amended assessment should be confirmed, 
reduced, increased or varied (as the case requires) 
in accordance with what it considers is just and 
equitable in all the circumstances of the 
application. 
 (9) When the Tribunal determines what is just and 
equitable under subsection (8) it will not be a 
relevant factor— 
 (a) that the contributor is applying for a review 
of the assessment or the amended 
assessment; and 
 (b) that the Authority made the assessment or 
the amended assessment. 
 (10) If a contributor has applied to the Tribunal for a 
review of the assessment or the amended 
assessment, the contributor and the Authority 
must on the request of the other party— 
 (a) provide a copy of every certificate or report 
by a medical practitioner that may be 
relevant to determining the liability of the 
contributor; and 
 (b) permit any medical practitioner who has 
given a certificate or report that may be 
relevant to determining the liability of the 
contributor to give evidence in the 
proceedings before the Tribunal under this 
Division. 
 (11) If the Tribunal increases an assessment, the 
Tribunal must determine that the contributor pay 
to the Authority or self-insurer interest at the 
prescribed rate upon the whole or part of the 
amount by which the amount of the increased 
assessment exceeds the amount of the assessment.

Tribunal must determine that the Authority or 
self-insurer pay to the contributor interest at the 
prescribed rate upon the whole or part of the 
amount by which the amount of the assessment 
exceeds the amount of the reduced assessment. 
 (13) If the Authority or the Tribunal determines that a 
contributor is entitled to a refund, the Authority or 
self-insurer must make the refund within 28 days 
of the determination. 
 (14) If the Authority or self-insurer fails to comply 
with subsection (13), it must pay interest at the 
prescribed rate for the period after the period 
specified in subsection (13) that the default 
continues. 
 (15) A court, other than the Tribunal exercising power 
under this Division, does not have jurisdiction to

attributable to any conduct or failure of the 
worker that is specified in that provision; or

compensation had been duly made, and 
(where applicable) an election to claim that 
compensation (instead of damages) had been 
duly made.

condition. 
 (5) If the Associate Judge of the Supreme Court does 
not grant the orders referred to in subsection (3),

135BD(a); 
serious silica-related condition means a condition 
that is— 
 (a) specified in an Order made under 
section 51A of the Workplace Injury

 (a) award, in the first instance, damages for the 
serious silica-related condition assessed on 
the assumption that the worker will not 
develop another serious silica-related 
condition (the initial award); and 
 (b) award damages at a future date if the worker 
does develop another serious silica-related 
condition (the subsequent award). 
135BE Only one subsequent award of damages permitted 
If an initial award of damages has been made to a 
worker in respect of a serious silica-related 
condition only one subsequent award of damages 
for another serious silica-related condition can be 
made to that worker. 
 135BF Regard must be had to initial award of damages 
If an initial award of damages has been made to a 
worker for a serious silica-related condition, a 
court must have regard to those damages when 
assessing damages to be awarded in a subsequent 
action for damages for another serious silica-
related condition suffered by that worker. 
135BG Regard must be had to legal costs incurred in initial 
action 
 (1) If an initial award of damages has been made to a 
worker for a serious silica-related condition, a 
court must have regard to the legal costs incurred 
in respect of the action for those damages (the 
initial action) when assessing the amount to be 
awarded as legal costs in a subsequent action for 
damages by that worker for another serious silica-
related condition. 
 (2) The purpose of subsection (1) is to ensure that 
legal costs awarded in a subsequent action are not 
in respect of work undertaken for the purposes of 
the initial action.

135BH Total award of damages not to exceed relevant 
statutory maximum 
Despite anything to the contrary in this Part, a 
worker is not entitled to an amount of damages 
under this Division to the extent that the total

of the death of the person in respect of whom the 
award is made, to the date of the award.

 (1) Where an injury or a death for which 
compensation has been paid, or is or may be 
payable, by the Authority, a self-insurer or an 
employer was caused under circumstances 
creating a liability in a third party to pay damages 
or that would have created such a liability if the 
injury or death had been caused in Victoria or that 
would, but for section 134A, create such a liability 
in respect of the injury or death, the Authority, 
self-insurer or employer is entitled to be 
indemnified by the third party in accordance with 
this section. 
 (2) In determining for the purposes of subsection (1) 
whether an injury or death was caused under 
circumstances creating a liability in a third party 
to pay damages or that would have created such a 
liability if the injury or death had been caused in 
Victoria in respect of the injury or death, 
Divisions 8A and 9 of Part IV must not be taken 
into account. 
 (3) The amount which a third party is required to pay 
as indemnity under subsection (1) is the lesser 
of— 
 (a) the amount of compensation paid or payable 
under this Act in respect of the injury or 
death; and

 (4) Judgment against or settlement by a third party in 
an action by a worker, or dependants of a worker, 
in respect of an injury or death referred to in 
subsection (1) does not eliminate or diminish the 
right of indemnity given by this section, except to 
the extent provided in this section. 
 (4A) A term of any contract that requires the employer 
or has the effect of requiring the employer to 
indemnify the third party in respect of any liability 
that the third party has or may have under this 
section is void. 
 (5) If the Transport Accident Commission is liable to 
make payment to the Authority under 
section 137(5A) or to a self-insurer under 
section 137(5B) in respect of a death or injury and 
the Authority or self-insurer is entitled under this 
section to be indemnified by a third party in 
respect of the liability, the entitlement of the 
Authority or self-insurer is subrogated to the 
Transport Accident Commission by virtue of this 
subsection. 
 (6) The Authority may, in its discretion, seek to 
recover any indemnity that the employer is 
entitled to under this section, including an amount 
that represents the employer's liability to pay 
compensation under section 125(1)(a) or 125A(3), 
on the employer's behalf, if— 
 (a) the Authority advises the employer of the 
Authority's intention to seek the indemnity 
for the employer; and 
 (b) the employer gives the Authority the 
employer's written consent to seek the 
indemnity under this section on the 
employer's behalf.

 (7) If the Authority recovers an amount from a third 
party on behalf of the employer that includes an 
amount that represents the employer's liability to

not be brought, whether against the Authority or

 138B Compensation for pain and suffering 
 
 
 (1) A court must not exercise the powers conferred by 
Subdivision (1) of Division 2 of Part 4 of the 
Sentencing Act 1991 to make a compensation 
order within the meaning of that Subdivision if the 
compensation would be for a matter arising from 
discriminatory conduct that constitutes an offence 
against section 242AA or for a matter— 
 (a) arising from an injury or death in respect of 
which it appears to the court that the person 
has an entitlement to any compensation 
under this Act; and 
 (b) arising from an event that constitutes an 
offence only against the Dangerous Goods 
Act 1985, the Occupational Health and 
Safety Act 2004 or the Equipment (Public 
Safety) Act 1994 or any regulations made 
under any of those Acts. 
 (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 
Subdivision (1) of Division 2 of Part 4 of the 
Sentencing Act 1991, this section applies to 
and in respect of any offence referred to in 
subsection (1) committed on or after the 
commencement of section 26 of the Accident 
Compensation (Common Law and Benefits) 
Act 2000. 
 (3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a person is 
not to be regarded as having an entitlement to any 
compensation under this Act if the entitlement 
would only arise under section 99(1)(b), 99(1)(c) 
or 92A (only by virtue of subsection (10)).

Section 98C, as amended by section 8 of the

Note 
The only effective changes made by section 8 are the inclusion of 
section 98C(2)(b), an increase to the formula amounts in 
section 98C(2)(c) and the inclusion of associated section 98C(2A).  
The other amendments made to amounts by section 8 were made 
for the purposes of consistency and merely reflect the amounts that 
applied under section 98C on the date of commencement of 
section 8 as a result of the indexation that occurred under 
section 100.  Therefore nothing in section 265 affects those 
amounts. 
 266 Section 99 (Compensation for medical and like

amending Act, only applies to claims for 
compensation under section 99 made after the

 (1) The amendments made to Part IV by Part 3 of the

the amendments made by Part 3 of that Act to and

 (3) If a period of incapacity for work resulted both 
from an injury that occurred before the date of 
commencement of Part 3 of the amending Act and 
an injury that occurred on or after that date, the 
incapacity is, for the purposes of the application of 
the amendments made by Part 3 of that Act to and

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).

• Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).

Grounds to Terminate Entitlement to Medical 
and Like Expenses 
AC Act Section as 
at 1 July 2010 
 • The worker requires modification of a 
prosthesis; 
 • The medical and like services is essential to 
ensuring the worker’s health or ability to 
undertake necessary tasks of daily living 
does not significantly deteriorate. 
 
1 Not technically a ground for termination as section 93EA(3) makes it clear 
a worker is entitled to a limited period of payments only (13 weeks) if this 
section applies.  No termination is required however a worker’s entitlement 
ceases after the period specified. 
2 As above, not a ground for termination but this section limits the period of 
payments and a worker’s entitlement ceases after the period specified. 
* Section 205 establishes a multi stage process where a worker does not 
comply with their return to work obligations imposed under sections 200, 
201, 202, 203 and 204 (Division 3).  The procedure is designed to 
encourage workers to return to work and section 205 provides the Authority 
or self insurer may either suspend or terminate weekly payments or cease 
and determine entitlement.  See section 205 for details on the operation of 
this provision. 
3 Entitlement ceases but no notice of termination is required. 
4 Non entitlement period applies after 28 days. 
5 Section 96(2) relates to a lump sum and section 96(6) relates to a pension.  
These sections may also apply to reduce weekly payment amount.
