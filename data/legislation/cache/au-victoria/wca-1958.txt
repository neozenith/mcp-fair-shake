the same employer in the grade in 
which the worker was employed at the

the right hand or of five fingers thereof or of the lower part of that 
arm or of a finger or part of a finger of the right hand shall be such 
amount as would have been payable for a similar loss in respect of 
his left arm or the part or parts thereof if he did not habitually use 
his left hand and arm to perform work usually performed by a 
worker with his right hand and arm. 
Where a worker suffers on the same occasion more than one of the injuries 
mentioned in this Table he shall not in any case be entitled to receive as 
compensation under this section and this Table more than the maximum 
amount payable under Clause 1(a)(ii) of The Clauses Referred To in section 9 
at the time of injury. 
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  
 (2) Where a worker suffers any injury— 
 (a) which as to the major part thereof consists of 
an injury for which compensation is payable 
under the said Table; or 
 (b) which consists of a lesser but substantial 
degree of any injury for which compensation 
is payable under the said Table— 
the injury shall, subject to the following 
provisions of this section, be regarded as an injury 
for which compensation based on the said Table 
shall be payable, and the County Court may award 
as compensation such amount as, having regard to 
the provisions of the said Table, appears to be just 
and proportionate to the degree of injury suffered. 
 (3) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section 
or in the said Table shall limit the amount of 
compensation payable for any injury during any 
period of incapacity due to illness resulting from 
that injury, and the amount of compensation 
payable pursuant to the foregoing provisions of 
this section and the said Table shall be payable in 
addition to any weekly payments payable in 
respect of incapacity due to that illness.

 (4) Where a worker has suffered an injury for which 
compensation would, but for the provisions of this 
subsection, be payable under the foregoing 
provisions of this section, and it appears to the 
County Court— 
 (a) that the amount of compensation which 
would be so payable would be substantially 
less than the amount of compensation which 
would be payable under the provisions of 
subsection (2) of section nine of this Act if 
compensation were assessable under that 
subsection; and 
 (b) that, because of the nature of his injury in 
relation to the nature of his former usual 
employment, the amount of compensation 
under the foregoing provisions of this section 
would be inadequate— 
then the County Court may award compensation 
pursuant to the provisions of the said subsection 
(2) of section nine without regard to the foregoing

subject to the provisions hereinafter contained the 
worker or his dependants shall be entitled to 
compensation under this Act as if the disease were 
a personal injury arising out of or in the course of 
that employment and the disablement shall be 
treated as the happening of the injury. 
 (2) Where a certificate has been given under and for 
the purposes of the last preceding subsection, then 
any claim arising thereon or in connexion 
therewith shall not be barred, avoided or 
invalidated by reason only of any defect, omission

such material as seems to it adequate and without 
regard to the rules of evidence, that the worker is 
or was suffering from a disease, that he is or was 
thereby disabled from earning full wages at the 
work at which he was employed and that the 
disease was due to the nature of the employment.

 12A Certificate by a registered medical practitioner 
After examination of the worker, the registered 
medical practitioner must give the worker— 
 (a) a certificate of disablement in the form

practitioner is not satisfied that the worker is 
entitled to a certificate of disablement.

 13 False representation 
If it is proved that the worker has at the time of 
entering the employment wilfully and falsely 
represented himself in writing as not having 
previously suffered from the disease 
compensation shall not be payable. 
 14 From which employer compensation recoverable 
The compensation shall be recoverable from the 
employer who last employed the worker prior to 
the date of disablement in the employment to the 
nature of which the disease was due, and notice of 
the death or disablement shall be given to that 
employer and may be so given notwithstanding 
that the worker has voluntarily left his 
employment: 
Provided that— 
 (a) the worker or his dependants if so required 
shall furnish that employer with such 
information as to the names and addresses of 
all the other employers who employed him in 
the employment prior to the date of 
disablement as he or they may possess, and if 
such information is not furnished or is not 
sufficient to enable that employer to take 
proceedings under the next following proviso 
that employer upon proving that the disease 
was not contracted whilst the worker was in 
his employment shall not be liable to pay 
compensation; 
 (b) if that employer alleges that the disease was 
in fact contracted whilst the worker was in 
the employment of some other employer and 
not whilst in his employment he may join 
such other employer as a party to the 
proceedings before the County Court or

compensation is to be recoverable; and 
 (c) if the disease is of such a nature as to be 
contracted by a gradual process any other 
employers who prior to the date of 
disablement employed the worker in the 
employment to the nature of which the 
disease was due shall be liable to make to the 
employer from whom compensation is 
recoverable such contributions as in default 
of agreement may be determined by the 
County Court or Administrative Appeals 
Tribunal in proceedings for settling the 
amount of the compensation. 
 15 Notice of death or disablement 
The notice of the death or disablement shall be 
sufficient if it is given in the same manner as 
notice of an injury may be given under this Act 
and if it conveys to the employer that the worker 
is suffering from the said disease and that the said 
disease is due to the nature of the employment and 
if it is accompanied by a copy of the certificate

 41 Time for taking proceedings 
Proceedings for the recovery under this Act of 
compensation for an injury shall not be 
maintainable— 
 (a) unless notice of the injury has been given as 
soon as practicable after the happening 
thereof and before the worker has voluntarily 
left the employment in which he was injured, 
but he shall not be deemed to have 
voluntarily left the employment in any case 
where by reason of the injury he was unable 
to continue in the employment; and 
 (b) unless the claim for compensation with 
respect to the injury has been made within 
six months from the occurrence of the injury, 
or in case of death within six months from 
the time of death: 
Provided that— 
 (a) the want of or any defect or inaccuracy in 
such notice shall not be a bar to the 
maintenance of such proceedings if the 
employer is proved to have had knowledge 
of the injury from any other source at or 
about the time of the injury or if it is found in 
the proceedings for settling the claim that the 
employer is not or would not if a notice or 
amended notice were then given and the 
hearing postponed be prejudiced in his 
defence by the want defect or inaccuracy, or 
that such want defect or inaccuracy was 
occasioned by mistake absence from Victoria 
or other reasonable cause; and

 (b) the failure to make a claim within the period 
above specified shall not be a bar to the 
maintenance of such proceedings if it is

was occasioned by mistake absence from 
Victoria or other reasonable cause; and 
 (c) without limiting the generality of the 
meaning of the expression ''reasonable 
cause'' in the last preceding paragraph of this 
proviso— 
 (i) the making of any payment to a worker 
which he believes to be a payment of 
compensation under this Act; or 
 (ii) any conduct on the part of the employer 
or his insurer or agent, or on the part of 
an employé of any of them purporting 
to act on behalf of the employer, 
whereby the worker is led to believe 
that compensation under this Act will 
or will probably be paid to him or 
whereby he is led to believe that he is 
not entitled to any such 
compensation— 
shall be deemed to be included in the meaning of 
that expression.

to a seaman employed on a Victorian ship as 
defined in this section if the injury arises out of or 
in the course of his employment and happens 
within this State or within the jurisdiction of this 
State. 
 (2) In this Act the term Victorian ship means any ship 
which is— 
 (a) registered in this State; or 
 (b) owned by a body corporate established under 
the laws of this State or having its principal 
office or place of business in this State or is 
in the possession of any such body corporate 
by virtue of a charter; or 
 (c) owned by any person or body corporate 
whose chief office or place of business in 
respect of the management of such ship is in 
this State or is in the possession of any such 
person or body corporate by virtue of a 
charter; or 
 (d) owned by the Crown in respect of the 
Government of this State, or is in the 
possession of the Crown in that respect by 
virtue of a charter.

 (a) the notice of injury and the claim for 
compensation may except where the person

where the injury happened and the incapacity 
commenced on board the ship it shall not be 
necessary to give any notice of the injury; 
 (b) in the case of the death of a seaman the claim 
for compensation shall be made within six 
months after the news of the death has been 
received by the claimant; 
 (c) in the case of a ship lost with all hands the 
claim for compensation shall be made within 
eighteen months after the date when the ship 
is deemed under this section to have been 
lost with all hands;

no dependants no compensation shall be 
payable if the owner or charterer of the ship 
is under any Act in force in Victoria liable to 
pay the expenses of burial or cremation; 
 (e) no weekly payments shall be payable in 
respect of any period during which the owner 
or charterer of the ship is under any other 
Act in force in Victoria liable to defray the 
expenses of maintenance of an injured 
seaman; 
 (f) compensation shall be paid in full in all cases 
notwithstanding any limitation of liability in

under the section of this Act relating to 
remedies both against employer and 
stranger—as if the indemnity were damages 
for loss of life or personal injury;

 (4) Without prejudice to any other means of proof 
available— 
 (a) a ship shall be deemed to have been lost with 
all hands on board if it is shown by some 
official return produced out of official 
custody or by other evidence that the ship on 
which the seaman in respect of whom the 
compensation is claimed was employed has 
twelve months or upwards before the 
institution of the proceedings left a port of 
departure and has not been heard of within 
twelve months of that departure; 
 (b) in the case of a ship lost with all hands a 
duplicate agreement or list of the crew made 
out and produced by the proper officer shall 
if produced out of official custody be in the 
absence of proof to the contrary sufficient 
evidence that the seamen therein named as 
belonging to the ship were on board at the 
time of the loss.

contracts with any other person (in this 
section referred to as the contractor) for the 
execution by or under the contractor of the 
whole or any part of any work undertaken by

 (b) Where compensation is claimed from or 
proceedings are taken against the principal 
contractor then in the application of this Act 
references to the principal contractor shall be 
substituted for references to the employer 
except that the amount of compensation shall 
be calculated with reference to the earnings 
of the worker under the employer by whom 
he is immediately employed. 
 (c) In the case of sub-contracts the words 
principal contractor shall extend to and 
include not only the original principal 
contractor but also each contractor who 
constitutes himself a principal contractor 
with respect to a sub-contractor by 
contracting with him for the execution by 
him of the whole or any part of the work, and 
the word contractor shall extend to and 
include not only the original contractor but 
also each sub-contractor, and each principal 
contractor's right to indemnity shall include a 
right against every contractor standing 
between him and the contractor by whom the 
worker was employed at the time when the 
injury occurred. 
 (2) When the principal contractor is liable to pay 
compensation under this section he shall be 
entitled to be indemnified by any person who 
would have been liable to pay compensation to the 
worker independently of this section, and all 
questions as to the right to and amount of any 
such indemnity shall in default of agreement be 
settled by the County Court or Administrative

apply in any case where any two or more persons 
in combination (herein referred to as a co-
operating party) or any person on behalf of any 
co-operating party enter or enters into a contract 
for any work in a gold mine or a coal mine and the

recover damages independently of this Act for the 
injury. 
 (3) Subject to this Act if it is determined in any 
proceedings under this Act that the injury is one 
for which the employer is not liable under this Act 
the determination shall not prevent an action being 
brought in respect of such injury independently of 
this Act. 
 63 Application of section 62 
 (1) Where, within the time limited for the taking of 
proceedings under this Act, an action is brought to 
recover damages independently of this Act in 
respect of an injury giving rise to a claim for 
compensation under this Act and it is determined 
in that action that— 
 (a) damages are recoverable independently of 
this Act subject to such reduction as is 
mentioned in section 26(1) of the Wrongs 
Act 1958; and 
 (b) the employer would have been liable to pay 
compensation under this Act— 
section 62 shall apply in all respects as if the 
action had been dismissed, and, if the claimant 
chooses to have compensation assessed and 
awarded in accordance with section 62, no 
damages shall be recoverable in the action. 
 (2) Where a worker has recovered compensation 
under this Act or any corresponding previous 
enactment in respect of an injury caused under 
circumstances which would give a right to recover 
reduced damages in respect thereof by virtue of 
section 26 of the Wrongs Act 1958 from some 
person other than the employer (the third part), 
any right conferred by this Division on the person 
by whom the compensation was paid, or on any 
person called on to pay an indemnity under 
Nos 5601

section 60, to be indemnified by the third party 
shall be limited to a right to be indemnified in 
respect of such part only of the sum paid or 
payable by the person as bears to the total sum so 
paid or payable the same proportion as the 
reduced damages bear to the total damages which 
would have been recoverable if the worker had 
not been at fault. 
 (3) Where either before or in an action brought to 
recover damages independently of this Act for 
injury, a judgment in favour of the worker for 
damages against the employer or the third party 
has been satisfied wholly or a claim has been 
settled fully the County Court or Administrative 
Appeals Tribunal shall refuse to make any award 
in favour of the worker or his dependants (as the 
case may be) for any damages caused by that 
injury. 
 (4) In an action brought to recover damages 
independently of this Act for damages for an 
injury or death, or in the case of an appeal against 
the judgment in such an action, the worker may, 
before the expiration of a period of 28 days after 
judgment or the determination of the appeal 
(as the case requires), abandon the judgment. 
 (5) Where a worker abandons the judgment pursuant 
to subsection (4), section 62 shall apply in all 
respects as if the action had been dismissed and if 
the worker chooses to have compensation 
assessed and awarded in accordance with 
section 62, no damages shall be recoverable in the 
action. 
 (6) Judgment shall not be abandoned pursuant to 
subsection (4) except within 28 days of the 
judgment being entered or in the case of an appeal 
within 28 days of the determination of the appeal.

person whether he has accepted payment of 
compensation under this Act or not.

entitled to claim compensation under this Act but 
not for an amount greater than the amount by

shall for the purposes of such judgment be 
deemed to be moneys recovered under such 
judgment and the amount owing thereunder shall

See www.legislation.vic.gov.au for Victorian Bills, Acts and current 
authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
The Workers Compensation Act 1958 was assented to on 30 September 
1958 and came into operation on 1 April 1959: Government Gazette 
18 March 1959 page 893. 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).  
• Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed

before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
