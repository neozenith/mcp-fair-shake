eventuating;  
 (b) the degree of harm that would result if the 
hazard or risk eventuated;

reasonably to know, about the hazard or risk 
and any ways of eliminating or reducing the

Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
