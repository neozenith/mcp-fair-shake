distributed throughout society; 
 (ii) equal application of a rule to different 
groups can have unequal results or 
outcomes;

may require the making of reasonable 
adjustments and reasonable

 (a) direct or indirect discrimination on the basis 
of an attribute; or  
 (b) a contravention of section 17, 19, 20, 22, 32, 
33, 40, 45, 54, 55 or 56.

 (4) In subsection (3)— 
assistance aid means any of the following that 
alleviates the effects of a person's 
disability— 
 (a) equipment (including a palliative or 
therapeutic device); 
 (b) a person who provides assistance or 
services to a person with a disability; 
Examples 
1 an interpreter; 
2 a reader. 
 (c) an assistance dog. 
 8 Direct discrimination 
 (1) Direct discrimination occurs if a person treats, or 
proposes to treat, a person with an attribute 
unfavourably because of that attribute. 
Examples 
1 An employer advises an employee that she will not be 
trained to work on new machinery because she is too 
old to learn new skills.  The employer has 
discriminated against the employee by denying her 
training in her employment on the basis of her age. 
2 A real estate agent refuses an African man's application 
for a lease.  The real estate agent tells the man that the 
landlord would prefer an Australian tenant.  The real 
estate agent has discriminated against the man by 
denying him accommodation on the basis of his race. 
 (2) In determining whether a person directly 
discriminates it is irrelevant— 
 (a) whether or not that person is aware of the 
discrimination or considers the treatment to 
be unfavourable; 
 (b) whether or not the attribute is the only or 
dominant reason for the treatment, provided 
that it is a substantial reason.

No. 26/2011

 9 Indirect discrimination 
 (1) Indirect discrimination occurs if a person imposes, 
or proposes to impose, a requirement, condition or 
practice— 
 (a) that has, or is likely to have, the effect of 
disadvantaging persons with an attribute; and 
 (b) that is not reasonable. 
 (2) The person who imposes, or proposes to impose, 
the requirement, condition or practice has the 
burden of proving that the requirement, condition 
or practice is reasonable. 
 (3) Whether a requirement, condition or practice is 
reasonable depends on all the relevant 
circumstances of the case, including the 
following— 
 (a) the nature and extent of the disadvantage 
resulting from the imposition, or proposed 
imposition, of the requirement, condition or 
practice; 
 (b) whether the disadvantage is proportionate to 
the result sought by the person who imposes, 
or proposes to impose, the requirement, 
condition or practice; 
 (c) the cost of any alternative requirement, 
condition or practice; 
 (d) the financial circumstances of the person 
imposing, or proposing to impose, the 
requirement, condition or practice;  
 (e) whether reasonable adjustments or 
reasonable accommodation could be made to 
the requirement, condition or practice to 
reduce the disadvantage caused, including 
the availability of an alternative requirement, 
condition or practice that would achieve the 
result sought by the person imposing, or

Equal Opportunity Act 2010 
No. 16 of 2010 
23   
proposing to impose, the requirement, 
condition or practice but would result in less 
disadvantage. 
 (4) In determining whether a person indirectly 
discriminates it is irrelevant whether or not that 
person is aware of the discrimination. 
Examples 
1 A store requires customers to produce photographic 
identification in the form of a driver's licence before 
collecting an order.  This may disadvantage a person with a 
visual impairment who is not eligible to hold a driver's 
licence.  The store's requirement may not be reasonable if the 
person with a visual impairment can provide an alternative 
form of photographic identification. 
2 An advertisement for a job as a cleaner requires an applicant 
to speak and read English fluently.  This may disadvantage a 
person on the basis of his or her race.  The requirement may 
not be reasonable if speaking and reading English fluently is 
not necessary to perform the job. 
 10 Motive is irrelevant to discrimination 
In determining whether or not a person 
discriminates, the person's motive is irrelevant. 
 11 Discrimination by acting with others and by not 
acting 
It is irrelevant whether discrimination occurs by a 
person— 
 (a) acting alone or in association with any other 
person; 
 (b) doing an act or omitting to do an act. 
 12 Special measures 
 (1) A person may take a special measure for the 
purpose of promoting or realising substantive 
equality for members of a group with a particular 
attribute.

2 A swimming pool that is located in an area with a 
significant Muslim population holds women-only 
swimming sessions to enable Muslim women who 
cannot swim in mixed company to use the pool. 
3 A person establishes a counselling service to provide 
counselling for gay men and lesbians who are victims 
of family violence, and whose needs are not met by 
general family violence counselling services. 
 (2) A person does not discriminate against another 
person by taking a special measure. 
 (3) A special measure must— 
 (a) be undertaken in good faith for achieving the 
purpose set out in subsection (1); and 
 (b) be reasonably likely to achieve the purpose 
set out in subsection (1); and 
 (c) be a proportionate means of achieving the 
purpose set out in subsection (1); and 
 (d) be justified because the members of the 
group have a particular need for 
advancement or assistance. 
 (4) A measure is taken for the purpose set out in 
subsection (1) if it is taken— 
 (a) solely for that purpose; or 
 (b) for that purpose as well as other purposes. 
 (5) A person who undertakes a special measure may 
impose reasonable restrictions on eligibility for 
the measure.

Example 
It may be reasonable to restrict eligibility for a special 
measure to people with the attribute who are of a particular 
age. 
 (6) A person who undertakes a special measure has 
the burden of proving that the measure is a special 
measure. 
 (7) On achieving the purpose set out in subsection (1), 
the measure ceases to be a special measure. 
 13 When is discrimination lawful? 
 (1) This Act does not prohibit discrimination to which 
a Division of Part 4 applies if— 
 (a) an exception in that Division applies; or  
 (b) the conduct constituting discrimination under 
that Division also constitutes discrimination 
under another Division of Part 4 and an 
exception in the other Division applies; or 
 (c) a general exception under Part 5 applies; or 
 (d) an exemption under Part 5 applies. 
Example 
A football club refuses to register a 15-year-old girl to 
participate in a football competition that is restricted to boys 
only.  Section 72 contains an exception from discrimination 
on grounds of sex in relation to competitive sporting 
activity.  If that applies to the competition, the club's refusal 
to register the girl will not be unlawful, regardless of 
whether any dispute about the refusal is brought as a dispute 
about discrimination in sport (Division 7), discrimination by 
a club (Division 6) or discrimination in the provision of 
services (Division 4). 
 (2) An exception or an exemption referred to in 
subsection (1) is a defence to discrimination, and 
the person seeking to rely on the exception or 
exemption has the burden of proving that it 
applies.

2 A large company undertakes an assessment of its 
compliance with this Act.  As a result of the 
assessment, the company develops a compliance

Part 9—Investigations 
Division 1—Commission may conduct investigation 
 
 
 127 When investigation may be conducted 
The Commission may conduct an investigation 
into any matter relating to the operation of this 
Act if— 
 (a) the matter— 
 (i) raises an issue that is serious in nature; 
and 
 (ii) relates to a class or group of persons; 
and 
 (iii) cannot reasonably be expected to be 
resolved by dispute resolution or by 
making an application to the Tribunal 
under section 122; and 
 (b) there are reasonable grounds to suspect that 
one or more contraventions of this Act have 
occurred; and 
 (c) the investigation would advance the 
objectives of this Act. 
Example 
An organisation has a policy that indirectly discriminates 
against persons with a particular attribute.  The Commission 
has received several calls complaining about this policy and 
the policy has received media attention.  Although some 
claims that the policy is discriminatory have been settled on 
an individual basis, the policy has not been changed.  
The Commission may decide that, in these circumstances, 
an investigation could help identify and eliminate a systemic 
cause of discrimination.

• Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001

foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B.
