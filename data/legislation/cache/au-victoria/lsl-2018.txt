At any time after completing 7 years of

 (2) If an employee takes long service leave before

leave for the period of employment in respect of 
which the leave in advance was taken.

1 General information 
See www.legislation.vic.gov.au for Victorian Bills, Acts and current 
authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
Minister's second reading speech— 
Legislative Assembly: 24 August 2017 
Legislative Council: 8 March 2018 
The long title for the Bill for this Act was "A Bill for an Act to make 
provision for the long service entitlements of certain employees, to repeal the 
Long Service Leave Act 1992, to make consequential amendments to 
various other Acts and for other purposes." 
The Long Service Leave Act 2018 was assented to on 15 May 2018 and 
came into operation on 1 November 2018: section 2(2). 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).

• Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and  
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
