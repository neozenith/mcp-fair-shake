      "content": "This Part has the core provisions for this Chapter, which deals with terms and conditions of employment of national system employees. The main terms and conditions come from the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations.\nThe National Employment Standards (Part2\u20112) are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.\nA modern award (see Part2\u20113), an enterprise agreement (see Part2\u20114) or a workplace determination (see Part2\u20115) provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom the award, agreement or determination applies. Only one of those instruments can apply to an employee at a particular time.\nDivision2 has the provisions to enforce the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements. It also sets out when a modern award or enterprise agreement applies to a person and the significance of that for this Act.\nNote:In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section279). For the rules about workplace determinations, see Part2\u20115.\nDivision3 deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.",

      "title": "Guide to this Part",
      "content": "This Partis about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.\nDivision2 deals with the making of enterprise agreements about permitted matters. An enterprise agreement (including a greenfields agreement) may be a single\u2011enterprise agreement or a multi\u2011enterprise agreement.\nDivision3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are bargaining representatives for such agreements.\nSubdivision A of Division4 deals with the approval of proposed enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an enterprise agreement is made.\nSubdivision B of Division4 deals with the approval of enterprise agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off overall test.\nDivision5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements, consultation requirements and the rights of workplace delegates.\nDivision6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise agreement.\nDivision7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise agreements.\nDivision8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making bargaining orders, intractable bargaining declarations, majority support determinations and scope orders. It also permits bargaining representatives to apply for the FWC to deal with bargaining disputes.\nDivision9 provides for the making of supported bargaining authorisations in relation to proposed multi\u2011enterprise agreements. The effect of such an authorisation is that specified employers are subject to certain rules that would not otherwise apply (for example, bargaining orders that would not usually be available for multi\u2011enterprise agreements will be available). It also permits the FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.\nDivision10 deals with single interest employer authorisations.\nDivision11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise agreements.",

      "content": "Approval of variation by the FWC\n(1)The FWC must approve a variation of a single interest employer agreement if:\n(a)an application for approval of the variation has been made under section216DA or 216DB; and\n(b)the FWC is satisfied that:\n(i)the employers and any employee organisations covered by the agreement have had an opportunity to express to the FWC their views (if any) on the application; and\n(ii)if the application was made by an employer under section216DA\u2014the variation has been genuinely agreed to by the affected employees in accordance with section216DD; and\n(iii)if the application was made by an employee organisation under section216DB\u2014the requirements of subsection(1A) are met; and\n(iv)the requirements of either subsection(2) or (3) (which deal with franchisees and common interest employers) are met; and\n(v)if the requirements of subsection(3) are met\u2014the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers who are covered by the agreement.\n(1AA)If:\n(a)the application for approval of the variation was made by an employee organisation under section216DB; and\n(b)the employer that will be covered by the agreement employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made;\nit is presumed for the purposes of subparagraph(1)(b)(v) that the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that are covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is proved.\nAdditional requirements for application by employee organisation\n(1A)The requirements of this subsection are met if:\n(a)the employer that will be covered by the agreement employed at least 20 employees at the time that the application for approval of the variation was made; and\n(b)a majority of the affected employees want to be covered by the agreement; and\n(c)subsection(1C) does not apply to the employer.\n(1B)For the purposes of paragraph(1A)(b), the FWC may work out whether a majority of the affected employees want to be covered by the agreement using any method the FWC considers appropriate.\n(1C)This subsection applies to an employer if:\n(a)the employer and the affected employees are covered by another enterprise agreement that has not passed its nominal expiry date at the time that the FWC will approve the variation; or\n(b)the employer and an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more of the affected employees have agreed in writing to bargain for a proposed single\u2011enterprise agreement that would cover the employer and the affected employees or substantially the same group of the affected employees.\nFranchisees\n(2)The requirements of this subsection are met if the employers covered by the agreement and the employer that will be covered by the agreement carry on similar business activities under the same franchise and are:\n(a)franchisees of the same franchisor; or\n(b)related bodies corporate of the same franchisor; or\n(c)any combination of the above.\nCommon interest employers\n(3)The requirements of this subsection are met if it is appropriate to approve the variation, having regard to:\n(a)whether the employers covered by the agreement and the employer that will be covered by the agreement have clearly identifiable common interests; and\n(b)whether it would be contrary to the public interest to approve the variation.\n(3A)For the purposes of paragraph(3)(a), matters that may be relevant to determining whether the employers have a common interest include the following:\n(a)geographical location;\n(b)regulatory regime;\n(c)the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement relates, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.\n(3AB)If:\n(a)the application for approval of the variation was made by an employee organisation under section216DB; and\n(b)the employer that will be covered by the agreement employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made;\nit is presumed that the requirements of subsection(3) are met, unless the contrary is proved.\nCalculating number of employees\n(3AC)For the purposes of calculating the number of employees referred to in paragraph(1AA)(b),(1A)(a) or (3AB)(b):\n(a)employeehas its ordinary meaning; and\n(b)subject to paragraph(c), all employees employed by the employer at the time that the application was made are to be counted; and\n(c)a casual employee is not to be counted unless, at that time, the employee is a regular casual employee of the employer; and\n(d)associated entities of the employer are taken to be one entity.\nEmployers and employees that are already bargaining\n(3B)Despite subsection(1), the FWC may refuse to approve the variation if the FWC is satisfied that:\n(a)the employer is bargaining in good faith for a proposed enterprise agreement that will cover the employer and the affected employees, or substantially the same group of the affected employees; and\n(b)the employer and the affected employees have a history of effectively bargaining in relation to one or more enterprise agreements that have covered the employer and the affected employees, or substantially the same group of the affected employees; and\n(c)on the day that the FWC will approve the variation, less than 9 months have passed since the most recent nominal expiry date of an agreement referred to in paragraph(b).\nGeneral building and construction work\n(4)Despite subsection(1), the FWC must not approve the variation if:\n(a)the agreement is a greenfields agreement that covers employees in relation to general building and construction work; or\n(b)as a result of the variation,the agreement would cover employees in relation to general building and construction work.\nSupported bargaining authorisation\n(5)Despite subsection(1), the FWC must not approve the variation if the employer that will be covered by the agreement is specified in a supported bargaining authorisation in relation to any of the affected employees.",

and\n(b)the FWC is satisfied that:\n(i)at least some of the employees that will be covered by the agreement are represented by an employee organisation; and\n(ii)the employers and the bargaining representatives of the employees of those employers have had the opportunity to express to the FWC their views (if any) on the authorisation; and\n(iii)if the application was made by 2 or more employers under paragraph248(1)(a)\u2014the requirements of subsection(1A) are met; and\n(iv)if the application was made by a bargaining representative under paragraph248(1)(b)\u2014each employer either has consented to the application or is covered by subsection(1B); and\n(v)the requirements of either subsection(2) or (3) (which deal with franchisees and common interest employers) are met; and\n(vi)if the requirements of subsection(3) are met\u2014the operations and business activities of each of those employers are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that will be covered by the agreement.\n(1AA)If:\n(a)the application for the authorisation was made by a bargaining representative under paragraph248(1)(b); and\n(b)an employer that will be covered by the agreement employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made;\nit is presumed that the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that will be covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is proved.\nAdditional requirements for application by employers\n(1A)The requirements of this subsection are met if:\n(a)the employers that will be covered by the agreement have agreed to bargain together; and\n(b)no person coerced, or threatened to coerce, any of the employers to agree to bargain together.\nAdditional requirements for application by bargaining representative\n(1B)An employer is covered by this subsection if:\n(a)the employer employed at least 20 employees at the time that the application for the authorisation was made; and\n(b)the employer has not made an application for a single interest employer authorisation that has not yet been decided in relation to the employees that will be covered by the agreement; and\n(c)the employer is not named in a single interest employer authorisation or supported bargaining authorisation in relation to the employees that will be covered by the agreement; and\n(d)a majority of the employees who are employed by the employer at a time determined by the FWC and who will be covered by the agreement want to bargain for the agreement; and\n(e)subsection(1D) does not apply to the employer.\n(1C)For the purposes of paragraph(1B)(d), the FWC may work out whether a majority of employees want to bargain using any method the FWC considers appropriate.\n(1D)This subsection applies to an employer if:\n(a)the employer and the employees of the employer that will be covered by the agreement are covered by an enterprise agreement that has not passed its nominal expiry date at the time that the FWC will make the authorisation; or\n(b)the employer and an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more of the employees of the employer that will be covered by the agreement have agreed in writing to bargain for a proposed single\u2011enterprise agreement that would cover the employer and those employees or substantially the same group of those employees.\nFranchisees\n(2)The requirements of this subsection are met if the employers carry on similar business activities under the same franchise and are:\n(a)franchisees of the same franchisor; or\n(b)related bodies corporate of the same franchisor; or\n(c)any combination of the above.\nCommon interest employers\n(3)The requirements of this subsection are met if:\n(a)the employers have clearly identifiable common interests; and\n(b)it is not contrary to the public interest to make the authorisation.\n(3A)For the purposes of paragraph(3)(a), matters that may be relevant to determining whether the employers have a common interest include the following:\n(a)geographical location;\n(b)regulatory regime;\n(c)the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.\n(3AB)If:\n(a)the application for the authorisation was made by a bargaining representative under paragraph248(1)(b); and\n(b)an employer that will be covered by the agreement employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made;\nit is presumed that the requirements of subsection(3) are met in relation to that employer, unless the contrary is proved.\nCalculating number of employees\n(3AC)For the purposes of calculating the number of employees referred to in paragraph(1AA)(b), (1B)(a) or (3AB)(b):\n(a)employeehas its ordinary meaning; and\n(b)subject to paragraph(c), all employees employed by the employer at the time that the application for the authorisation was made are to be counted; and\n(c)a casual employee is not to be counted unless, at that time, the employee is a regular casual employee of the employer; and\n(d)associated entities of the employer are taken to be one entity.\nOperation of authorisation\n(4)The authorisation:\n(a)comes into operation on the day on which it is made; and\n(b)ceases to be in operation at the earlier of the following:\n(i)at the same time as the enterprise agreement to which the authorisation relates is made;\n(ii)12 months after the day on which the authorisation is made or, if the period is extended under section252, at the end of that period.",

and\n(b)the requirements of either subsection(2A) or (2B) are met.\n(2A)The requirements of this subsection are met if the FWC is satisfied that:\n(a)the employers specified in the authorisation and the bargaining representatives of the employees of those employers have had an opportunity to express to the FWC their views (if any) on the application; and\n(b)because of a change in the employer\u2019s circumstances, it is no longer appropriate for the employer to be specified in the authorisation.\n(2B)The requirements of this subsection are met if:\n(a)the application was made by a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement to which the authorisation relates; and\n(b)the FWC is satisfied that:\n(i)the employer (therelevant employer) whose name is proposed to be removed employed fewer than 50 employees at the time that the application was made; and\n(ii)the employers specified in the authorisation and the bargaining representatives of the employees of those employers have had the opportunity to express to the FWC their views (if any) on the application; and\n(iii)the employees (therelevant employees) who are employed by the relevant employer and that would be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement to which the authorisation relates have, on request by the bargaining representative, approved the removal of the relevant employer\u2019s name by voting for the removal; and\n(iv)there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the removal of the relevant employer\u2019s name has not been genuinely approved by the relevant employees.\n(2C)Without limiting subparagraph(2B)(b)(iii), the bargaining representative may request that the relevant employees vote by ballot or by an electronic method.\n(2D)For the purposes of subparagraph(2B)(b)(iii), the relevant employees are taken to have approved the removal of the employer\u2019s name if:\n(a)at least 50% of the relevant employees cast a vote; and\n(b)more than 50% of the valid votes were votes approving the removal.\nVariation to add employer\n(3)The following may apply to the FWC for a variation of a single interest employer authorisation to add the name of an employer (thenew employer) that is not specified in the authorisation to the authorisation:\n(a)the new employer;\n(b)a person who is a bargaining representative:\n(i)for the proposed enterprise agreement to which the authorisation relates; and\n(ii)of an employee of the new employer.\n(4)The FWC must vary the authorisation to add the new employer\u2019s name if:\n(a)an application for the variation has been made; and\n(b)the FWC is satisfied that:\n(i)the employers specified in the authorisation and the bargaining representatives of the employees of those employers have had an opportunity to express to the FWC their views (if any) on the application; and\n(ii)if the application was made by the new employer under paragraph(3)(a)\u2014no person coerced, or threatened to coerce, the new employer to make the application; and\n(iii)if the application was made by a bargaining representative under paragraph(3)(b)\u2014the requirements of subsection(5) are met; and\n(iv)the requirements of subsection249(2) or (3) (which deal with franchisees and common interest employers) would continue to be met if the new employer\u2019s name were added; and\n(v)if the requirements of subsection249(3) would continue to be met if the new employer\u2019s name were added\u2014the operations and business activities of the new employer are reasonably comparable with those of the employers specified in the authorisation.\n(4A)If:\n(a)the application for approval of the variation was made by a bargaining representative under paragraph(3)(b) of this section; and\n(b)the new employer employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made; and\n(c)the requirements of subsection249(2) do not apply to the new employer;\nthen the following matters are presumed, unless the contrary is proved:\n(d)that the requirements of subsection249(3) would continue to be met if the new employer\u2019s name were added;\n(e)that, for the purposes of subparagraph(4)(b)(v) of this section, the operations and business activities of the new employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that are specified in the authorisation.\nAdditional requirements for application by bargaining representative\n(5)The requirements of this subsection are met if:\n(a)the new employer employed at least 20 employees at the time that the application for the variation was made; and\n(b)the new employer has not made an application for a single interest employer authorisation that has not yet been decided in relation to the employees that will be covered by the agreement; and\n(c)the new employer is not named in a single interest employer authorisation or supported bargaining authorisation in relation to the employees that will be covered by the agreement; and\n(d)a majority of the employees who are employed by the new employer at a time determined by the FWC and who will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement want to bargain for the agreement; and\n(e)subsection(7) does not apply to the employer.\n(5A)For the purposes of calculating the number of employees referred to in subparagraph(2B)(b)(i) or paragraph(4A)(b) or (5)(a):\n(a)employeehas its ordinary meaning; and\n(b)subject to paragraph(c), all employees employed by the new employer at the time that the application for the variation was made are to be counted; and\n(c)a casual employee is not to be counted unless, at that time, the employee is a regular casual employee of the new employer; and\n(d)associated entities of the new employer are taken to be one entity.\n(6)For the purposes of paragraph(5)(d), the FWC may work out whether a majority of employees want to bargain using any method the FWC considers appropriate.\n(7)This subsection applies to an employer if:\n(a)the new employer and the employees of the new employer that will be covered by the agreement are covered by an enterprise agreement that has not passed its nominal expiry date at the time that the FWC will make the variation; or\n(b)the new employer and an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of one or more of the employees of the new employer that will be covered by the agreement have agreed in writing to bargain for a proposed single\u2011enterprise agreement that would cover the new employer and those employees or substantially the same group of those employees.\nEmployers and employees that are already bargaining\n(8)Despite subsection(4), the FWC may refuse to vary the authorisation if the FWC is satisfied that:\n(a)the new employer is bargaining in good faith for a proposed enterprise agreement that will cover the new employer and the employees of the new employer that will be covered by the agreement, or substantially the same group of those employees; and\n(b)the new employer and those employees have a history of effectively bargaining in relation to one or more enterprise agreements that have covered the new employer and those employees, or substantially the same group of those employees; and\n(c)on the day that the FWC will vary the authorisation, less than 9 months have passed since the most recent nominal expiry date of an agreement referred to in paragraph(b).",
